My PHP Foundation
This code is neither a library nor a framework. I call it a foundation.

I have, for various reasons, rejected frameworks. The primary reason being I naturally resist being told how to do things. The irony of this position is that this foundation definitely has a philosophy and set of best practices. But these are my choices and you're allowed to take them or leave them at your whim.

This foundation is intended to make web applications easy to make, for the programmer, without undo sacrifice of performance. The focus on the programmer means that this code attempts to encapsulate raw PHP functions and common functions. This also means that the foundation facilitates data integrity and error handling. It gives the author all the tools needed to confirm the data is present and reasonable, and that errors are located to the actual origin of the problem.

However, make no mistake, the first line of defense is programmer discipline. A disciplined programmer will, in general, write good code. But no programmer is perfect, and code is often exposed to data which may be outside the allowed ranges. The foundation makes it easy to confirm the data conforms to your specifications.
